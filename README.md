## Comparative Analysis of AAA and Indie Game Publishers for 2024 Releases

This postgraduate research aims to conduct a comparative analysis between AAA and Indie game publishers using data from games released between January 1, 2024, and September 9, 2024. The analysis is based on a single comprehensive dataset that includes key variables such as game titles, release dates, copies sold, prices, total revenue, average playtime, review scores, publisher classifications (AAA, Indie, etc.), and the names of developers and publishers.

The study will focus on graphically representing the main differences between AAA and Indie publishers, examining market trends, sales performance, audience appeal, and critical reception within this specific timeframe. By leveraging data solely from 2024 releases, the research aims to capture the latest industry dynamics, highlighting how recent market trends affect both AAA and Indie game success.

Graphical analysis will visualize differences in average revenue, review scores, and pricing strategies between the two types of publishers. The study will also investigate correlations between playtime, release timing, and sales performance, providing insights into the effectiveness of different publishing strategies in the current market landscape.

This approach will offer a timely and focused view of how AAA and Indie publishers are navigating the 2024 gaming market, illustrating the distinct paths these sectors take to engage audiences and achieve commercial success.
